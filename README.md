## ngBoilerplate integration

We use the ngBoilerplate project (https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) as a base for our AngularJS application. To integrate it into our NodeJS application we did the following:

* copied `karma/`, `src/`, `vendor/``.bowerrc`, `.gitmodules`, `bower.json`, `build.config.js`, `changelog.tpl` `Gruntfile.js`, `module.prefix`, `module.suffix`, `tools.md` to the root
* merged `package.json`, `.gitignore` files
* adjust `build.config.js` to deploy the app into `/public` instead of `bin`
* added a post script to install bower dependencies and run grunt:

    "scripts": {
      ...
      "postinstall" : "postinstall" : "npm install -g grunt bower && bower install && grunt
    },
